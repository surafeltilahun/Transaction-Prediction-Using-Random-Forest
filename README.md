The repository contains transactional data prediction analysis using random forests. This dataset is a real-world transactional dataset with highly imbalanced input variables. A binary classification is used in which 0 means there was no transaction on a particular date, but 1 means that a transaction was carried out on that date. This project faces a data imbalance challenge. In my experiment, I used the grid search method to test alternative combinations of hyperparameters and undersampling approaches for a random forest model. A random forest is computationally expensive since it generates and combines the results of multiple decision trees. Therefore, I have chosen to undersample the dataset rather than oversample it.
